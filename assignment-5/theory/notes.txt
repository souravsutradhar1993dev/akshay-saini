#1. What is the difference between "Named" Export, "Default" export and "* as" export?

"Named" Export => By using this export, we can export multiple modules per file. To import, we need to use curly braces and need to use the same module name in those curly braces.

"Default" Export => By using this export, we can only export one module per file. We don't need to use curly braces here for import and also we can use any other during import.

"* as" Export => Using this export, we can import all the named export by defining a js object and we can access any module using '.' operator into it.

#2. What is the importance of config.js file?

In config.js file, we can define all the constant variables and can use it wherever we need it throughout the components by just "Named" exporting this. It helps in code redundancy.

#3. What are React Hooks?

React Hooks are just a normal javascript functions where we can put the reusable functionality of a component and use it throughout the components. Hooks can be stateful.

#4. Why do we need a "useState" Hook?

We need "useState" Hook to declare react state variables and use those state variables to maintain the state of a component.
